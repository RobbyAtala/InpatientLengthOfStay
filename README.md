These days there is a lot of emphasis on patients length of stay "los" in the hospital. Hospitals and third party payers want patients to 
be discharged as soon as they get better and no longer need hospital care. That way, a lot of money could be saved and invested in
optimizing healthcare delivery.
So "los" is one of the metrics on which some physicians like hospitalists are evaluated these. The lowest the "los" for a particular
physician is, the better s/he is regarded in terms of performance.
In this project, I analyse the "los" for several physicians to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the many 
physicians or not.
